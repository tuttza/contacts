# contacts
Contacts CLI app written in Rust!

This is a minimal CLI app that stores your contacts locally in binary format.

To get started simply download the [executable](https://github.com/tuttza/contacts/releases/download/v0.0.1/contacts.exe) (only for `Windows` right now, but will work on any system it is complied on) or compile yourself
and run `contacts add` to get started.
